        <h2>What Is a Daily Interest Calculator?</h2>
        <p>A daily interest calculator tells you exactly how much interest accrues on a sum of money for each day it
          sits in a loan, savings account, fixed deposit, or investment. Instead of waiting for your monthly bank
          statement, you get a clear, day-by-day picture of how interest builds — whether you're a borrower trying to
          understand costs or a saver watching your money grow.</p>
        <p>Most financial institutions calculate interest on a daily basis, even if they only show you the figure
          monthly. That means the numbers are moving every single day. Our calculator brings those hidden daily
          movements to the surface.</p>

        <h2>Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest</h2>
        <div class="comparison-grid">
          <div class="comparison-card">
            <h3>Simple Interest</h3>
            <p>Simple interest is the most straightforward method. You earn (or owe) interest only on the original
              principal — the amount never changes as a base. It's commonly used for short-term loans, personal loans,
              car loans, and some government bonds.</p>
            <div class="formula">Formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time (in years)</div>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> ₹10,000 at 8% annual rate for 90 days<br>
              Daily interest = ₹10,000 × 8% ÷ 365 = ₹2.19 per day<br>
              Total interest for 90 days = ₹197.26</p>
          </div>
          <div class="comparison-card">
            <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
            <p>Compound interest is where the real power of money shows up. Here, interest is added to the principal at
              regular intervals — daily, monthly, or annually — and then that larger amount starts earning interest too.
              Over time, this creates exponential growth (or exponential debt).</p>
            <div class="formula">Formula: A = P × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)</div>
            <p>Savings accounts, fixed deposits, mutual funds, and most investment vehicles use compound interest. The
              more frequently it compounds, the faster your money grows.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> Even a difference of 0.5% in annual interest rate can translate to thousands of
                dollars over a few years thanks to compounding.</em></p>

        <h2>How to Use This Calculator</h2>
        <p>Using the daily interest calculator takes less than 30 seconds:</p>
        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li><strong>Enter your principal</strong> — This is the starting amount. For a loan, it's what you borrowed.
            For savings, it's what you deposited.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the annual interest rate</strong> — Use the rate shown on your loan agreement or bank
            account. Enter it as a percentage (e.g., 7.5 for 7.5%).</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the number of days</strong> — How many days does the interest period cover? You can also
            pick a start and end date and let the calculator count the days automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose your mode</strong> — Select Simple Interest for straightforward calculations, or Compound
            Interest and choose how often it compounds (daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Click Calculate</strong> — Instantly see your daily interest, total interest, final amount, and a
            full period breakdown.</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-accordion">
          <details>
            <summary>How is daily interest calculated?</summary>
            <p>Daily interest is calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 365 and multiplying by your
              principal. For simple interest: Daily Interest = Principal × (Annual Rate ÷ 365).</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use this for credit card interest?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Most credit cards compound interest daily. Enter your balance as principal, APR as annual rate, and
              select Compound Interest with Daily frequency.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does early loan repayment save money?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely. Since interest accrues daily on the remaining principal, every extra payment reduces your
              interest charges the very next day.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is the Rule of 72?</summary>
            <p>Divide 72 by your annual interest rate to estimate how many years it takes for your money to double with
              compound interest. At 6%, it takes about 12 years.</p>
